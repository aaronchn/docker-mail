docker-mailserver
=================

Fork from jeboehm/docker-mailserver.

Thanks to the original author's code!

Based on the original author, my primary goal is to change mysql-based user validation to ldap-based. On this basis, only key components of the reserved mail service, such as MTA, MDA, and Filter, are retained.
